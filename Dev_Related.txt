Database design:-

1---Where is all the employee data saved.---

All employee profiles saved in empDB:-
empDB - empid: profileObject}

2-----Who is the admin------
this will be specified through and object.
adminList:{emailIDs:[...]}

Whoever is the list, will have admin access.

3----User Access Rules-----
That is, who all are allowed to signup with the app.

userAccessRules:-
Specified through an object. Will make it oart of admin module.
{
allowAll: <all/allowAllExcept/allowOnly>,
allowAllExcept:[<email_ids>],
allowOnly:[<email_ids>]
}

The logic is simple:-  Whenever a user tries to login, the system will query the userAccessRules and will proceed accordingly.
